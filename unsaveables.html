<h2 style="text-align: left;"><span style="color: #3366ff;">Unsaveables</span></h2>
<h2 style="text-align: left;">&nbsp;</h2>
<h2 style="text-align: left;"><span style="color: #3366ff;">Unsaveables are, unfortunately, all around us. They are silent. They are noisy. They ignore the truth. They want for everything and yet they seek nothing. Your wife may be Unsaveable. Your son may be. So may Grandma. Your therapist is doomed, as are most of the docters, teachers, priests, lawyers and judges.</span></h2>
<h2 style="text-align: left;"><span style="color: #3366ff;">They are wrong and Kraff has seen through their lies and pretty delusions and that, as will be made clear - is precisely the point of this Paradigm. The Tract may soon be written - and it will make clear one very simple point. To doubt is not scientific - it is the opposite of science.</span></h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 style="text-align: left;"><span style="color: #3366ff;">It is the faux science of faux scientists who only wear those silly coats because they are sick human beings. True descendants of Kraff will get everything they want. As for the Unsaveables - they are in for a big surprise. Just as soon as we have thought of it.</span></h2>
