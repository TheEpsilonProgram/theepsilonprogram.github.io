<h2 style="text-align: left;"><span style="color: #3366ff;">Beliefs and Practices of The Epsilon Program</span></h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 style="text-align: left;"><span style="color: #3366ff;">Beliefs. Life. Answers. Payment plans. All are part of the wonders of the Epsilon Program that will be revealed to you in due course. Do you think we were going to take you on a journey to your soul for free? All the best journeys eventually come to a roll road. You can pay, or you can be lost in the wilderness, it is your choice.</span></h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><span style="color: #0000ff;">Many awful lies have been spread by whistleblowers, bitter ex-Exsilonists, hidden camera documentaries and so-called investigative journalists in recent years, so we'd like to clear up some of the common misconceptions.</span></h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 style="text-align: left;"><span style="color: #3366ff;">Q1: What is The Epsilon Program?</span></h2>
<h2 style="text-align: left;"><span style="color: #3366ff;">The Epsilon Program is a major would religion with members in 152 countries. It employs science and means of clear thinking that empowers its followers to become living manifestations of the divine, through an understanding of the metaphors central to it, and human history, biology and psychology. Epsilonists are free from illness, insecurity or any other form of weakness. Many live to be 300 years old or more.</span></h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 style="text-align: left;"><span style="color: #3366ff;">Q2: When can drugs/medicine be used?</span></h2>
<h2 style="text-align: left;"><span style="color: #3366ff;">Drugs should only be used for mind expansion and never medical purposes. Epsilonists prefer the term vitamins. Medical procedures for the betterment of the external self, like cosmetic surgery, are acceptable and encouraged. Most other medicine is a fraud. The FACT is that science is full of lies. For example, many people used to think the world was flat.</span></h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 style="text-align: left;"><span style="color: #3366ff;">Q3: How do you explain all the fossils and other evidence proving that dinosaurs existed?</span></h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 style="text-align: left;"><span style="color: #3366ff;">Kraff places many things in the world to confuse and challenge us, and weed out Objectionable Persons and Unsaveables. The FACT is you've never seen a dinosaur, aside from in the movies. But you have seen a hot fire - fancy spending eternity in one of those?</span></h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 style="text-align: left;"><span style="color: #3366ff;">Q4: How can the world still be 157 years old?</span></h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 style="text-align: left;"><span style="color: #3366ff;">Its age does not change. Time is irrelevant to eternal truth. The Fourth Paradigm is quadrillions of years old. This is the Nint Paradigm and this Earth is its centerpiece. The FACT is you weren't alive 157 years ago, so you do not know for sure and Epsilonism provides a more complete understanding than so-called geology.</span></h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 style="text-align: left;"><span style="color: #3366ff;">Q5: Why are you so secretive about Kraff?</span></h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 style="text-align: left;"><span style="color: #3366ff;">It is a truth so simple yet powerful, it cannot be revealed until you have the technology to understand it, and until technology has processed your bank account. Learning the wonder of Kraff's teachings and plan for us too soon, without sufficient spiritual and financial investment, can cause great harm to the science of the mind. The FACT is Kraff loves those who love themselves by committing to a life of Epsilonism.</span></h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 style="text-align: left;"><span style="color: #3366ff;">Q6: Is Epsilon a religion?</span></h2>
<h2 style="text-align: left;">&nbsp;</h2>
<h2 style="text-align: left;"><span style="color: #3366ff;">For tax purposes, yes.</span></h2>
